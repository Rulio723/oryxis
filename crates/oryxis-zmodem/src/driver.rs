//! Async driver that runs one ZMODEM transfer to completion.
//!
//! `zmodem2` is a synchronous poll/submit state machine; this wraps it
//! in a tokio task that pumps its [`Action`]s against the pane's
//! transport (the `WriteWire` bytes go out through the session's input
//! sender, exactly where a keystroke would) and the local filesystem
//! (`WriteFile` for a download, `ReadFile` for an upload). Wire input
//! arrives on a channel the app fills with the bytes it diverts from
//! the terminal; progress and the terminal result flow back on another.
//!
//! Design constraints that shaped this:
//!
//! - **No blocking dialogs mid-flight.** ZMODEM peers time out, so the
//!   destination (a download folder) and the source (an upload file)
//!   are decided by the caller BEFORE the driver starts; the driver
//!   never stops to ask.
//! - **`submit_wire` may take only part of a chunk** (heapless internal
//!   buffer), so unconsumed wire is retained and re-submitted rather
//!   than dropped.
//! - **Abort is cooperative but must never wait on the peer**: a shared
//!   flag lets the app request cancellation, and an empty chunk on
//!   `wire_in` wakes a driver parked on a silent peer's `recv` so the
//!   flag is actually seen. On abort the driver writes the canonical
//!   `CANCEL` sequence itself (`zmodem2`'s `abort()` only queues the
//!   `Aborted` event; it stages no wire bytes), so the remote tears
//!   down cleanly instead of waiting out its timeout.
//! - **Completion is not the end of the wire.** `poll()` yields events
//!   before queued wire bytes, so `SessionCompleted` arrives while the
//!   final handshake (the receiver's ZFIN reply, the sender's "OO") is
//!   still queued. The loops keep pumping until `Idle` before
//!   returning; a download then also absorbs the peer's trailing "OO".
//!   Returning on the event alone left the remote `sz` retrying ZFIN
//!   against silence, holding its tty for ~20 s of timeouts (issue
//!   #77). A local error sends `CANCEL` for the same reason: the peer
//!   must never be left to wait out its own clock.
