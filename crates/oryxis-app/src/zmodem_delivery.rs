//! Where a ZMODEM download lands when the user is asked, and when.
//!
//! "Ask where to save downloads" used to run the folder dialog BEFORE
//! the driver spawned, so the remote `sz` sat on its opening header
//! waiting for the receiver to answer, and stock lrzsz gives that up
//! after about 30 s (`sz -t` is its own knob, tenths of a second, and
//! nothing on this side can move it). The reporter of issue #230 asked
//! for that timeout to be configurable; the honest answer is to stop
//! racing it. So the driver now starts at once, receiving into a
//! STAGING folder of the app's own, the dialog runs meanwhile, and each
//! finished file is moved to the chosen folder once both are known. The
//! dialog can stay open as long as the user likes.
//!
//! The rules, each one a test below:
//!
//! - Answered before a file completes: that file moves on its
//!   `FileDone`, and the ones already finished move right away.
//! - A file is delivered under the name the SENDER announced
//!   (sanitized), never under the name it happened to get in staging:
//!   a same-named file already parked there would otherwise hand the
//!   picked folder a " (1)" it has no collision to explain.
//! - Answered after the whole transfer completed: the parked files
//!   move, and the app says where they went, because the completion
//!   toast has already fired with no location to name.
//! - Declined while the transfer runs: the driver is asked to abort
//!   (flag plus wake-up, the driver sends the CANCEL sequence itself,
//!   never this module: after the driver has ended the divert is gone
//!   and those bytes would land in the shell), and once it has ended
//!   the part file of the file in flight is deleted with its owner
//!   record. A declined download is not something to resume, and in a
//!   folder every host shares a part nobody wants is only a trap for
//!   the next file of the same name.
//! - Declined after the last file finished but before the sender's
//!   sign-off: the session still ends `Completed` on the wire, and the
//!   relay reports it as [`DeliveryEvent::Declined`] so the app does
//!   not announce a download it has just thrown away.
//! - Declined after it completed: the finished files of THIS transfer
//!   are deleted, by the paths their `FileDone` reported; the folder
//!   is never swept.
//! - A move that fails is reported by name with where the file stayed,
//!   never redirected somewhere the user did not pick.
//!
//! Staging is ONE fixed folder (`~/.oryxis/incoming`, 0700 on unix),
//! not one per transfer: the driver's `<name>.oryxis-part` is what a
//! later `sz` of the same file resumes from, and a folder minted per
//! transfer would lose that. Because every host shares it, the driver
//! is given a resume OWNER (the saved host, or the pane for a host that
//! was never saved) and a part resumes only for the owner it records.
//!
//! Several windows (and several transfers) share the folder, so a
//! staged transfer holds a SHARED lock on `.lock` in it for as long as
//! its relay lives ([`StagingClaim`]), and the boot scan takes an
//! EXCLUSIVE one without waiting: another process mid-dialog makes the
//! scan stand down whole, so it can never touch a live transfer's parked
//! files, parts or name reservations. An OS file lock dies with its
//! process, which is what makes it a liveness test with no pid
//! bookkeeping to go stale.
//!
//! What a closed window left behind is NOT delivered on its own. Those
//! files arrived under "ask" and nobody answered; putting them in the
//! default folder would answer for the user, and the remote host
//! decided their names and contents. So [`scan_staging`] only reports
//! them, the app offers to save them to a folder the user picks, and
//! until then they stay where they are (the offer repeats at the next
//! launch). Parts and owner records older than [`PART_MAX_AGE`] are
//! expired by the same scan: nothing resumes a transfer that old.
//!
//! Uploads are untouched: there is nothing to send before a file is
//! picked, so their picker keeps running first.
